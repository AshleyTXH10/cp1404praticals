# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

100%

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

I have schedule to begin watching lecture videos on Sunday as on Monday after the lecture time I have another lecture and other praticals and have no time to watch the programming 2 lectures. I watch the lecture videos in a quiet place as I can sometimes be easily distracted. I try to finish the lecture videos in one sitting while taking breaks inbetween the videos.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

So far what I think I'm doing well is getting started on the praticals and online test early that way I don't have to worry about having time to finish them and that way also manage my time for all my pratical work from different courses as well.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

What I feel that I need to change is improving my comments and docstrings as previously when I learnt code I hadn't learnt to write them.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

I don't read questions and instructions carefully and I tend to miss out on information which I caused me to miss alot of important things.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

I'm always excited to code and the praticals feel more like puzzles to me instead of work and I feel that this motivates me to finish the praticals before the submission time and also do the praticals properly and well.
