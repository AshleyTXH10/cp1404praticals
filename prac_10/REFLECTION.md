# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...
Most of the time, my estimates are somewhat accurate as it will only be off by a few minutes, but in many of the praticals
I tend to underestimate the amount of time I would take for each tasks. Usually these are tasks that look simple to me but take 
up alot of time because of debugging or reading and understand code provided.
### How was your estimate accuracy usually?
My accuracy was overall was mixed. Most of my estimates ranged between a few minutes off to ten minutes off usually, but
for many of my tasks I tend to underestimate them. I think this is because of how long I spent debugging code and the amount
of errors that typically come out when programming, I think this is because I tend to code a chunk of code instead of
smaller manageable chunks.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?
The more praticals I did my estimated accuracy seem get more and more accurate, I think this is because at the start of the
course praticals tend to seem easy, so I predicted I could finish them faster but because I underestimated the task and
didn't break down the coding into small chunks I spent alot of time debugging and looking for errors in my code. But as 
I progress through the praticals I started to do this better and for some I saw that I actually completed the task faster 
then what I estimated I would take to complete the task.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?
To not be too confident in your abilities and It really does make it much easier to code step by step and check to make 
sure your code runs the way it is intended to after each step. That way its much easier to find errors and catch bugs early.
I also learnt to allocated myself more time to finish praticals  as most of the time I take longer to finish the task.

## Code Reviews

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.
