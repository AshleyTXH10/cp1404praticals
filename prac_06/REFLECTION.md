# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?
The changes I made to my process based on my own personal reflection are firstly understanding what the problem is asking for
and based on that plan my code, and also to rest my programs frequently instead of at the end that way i can identify problems
early and catch small errors.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?
What I believe I still need to change is the amount of time I leave to finish praticals. I usually start my praticals early
but then forget about them or when I come back I'm lost as I had forgotten where I left off. My goal is to set a few dates right after
each other to complete praticals that way I won't have to face these problems.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?
I believe I am doing well in starting my praticals early as coding is really fun for me and I usually look forward to 
starting and doing the praticals.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?
I believe I need to start looking at feedback and understanding where I go wrong and I seem to be constanly repeating the 
same mistakes proving I don't really understand my mistake.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?
I suggest having more clearer instructions on certain things for example what excatly is looked for github commits or comments.
